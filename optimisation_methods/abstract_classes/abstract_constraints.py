        1. Let's assume, that x_0 is the solution of the system:
        A x_0 = b

        2. So we can suppose, that we find projection of (y - x_0) vector
        on the linear subspace L defined as follow:
        A x = 0
        
        3. Let's define y_0 := (y - x_0) 

        4. Let's suppose, that y* is the solution of our task
        This means, that p = (y_0 - y*) vector orthogonal to L

        5. So, we can notice, that in view of rows a_1, ..., a_k 
        of A matrix are orthogonal to L and 
        <a_1, a_2 ... a_k> is the orthogonal component of L, so
        p \in <a_1, a_2 ... a_k>
        
        6. Let's suppose  {a_i_1, a_i_2, ... , a_i_m}, where m <= k ,is the 
        basis of <a_1, a_2 ... a_k>. 
        Define {a'_1, ... , a'_m } := {a_i_1, a_i_2, ... , a_i_m}

        7. Let's define A' := (a'_1, ... , a'_m) , where A' is the matrix
        and a'_i are rows of this matrix (In the code below A' = A_indep)
        Also let's define b' := (b_i_1, ... b_i_m) (In the code b' = b_indep)

        8. So p = alpha_1 * a'_1  + ... + alpha_m * a'_m
        In matrix symbols, p = A'.T * alpha

        9. Let.s notice, that y_0 - p = y*, 
        y* belongs to L, so 0 = A' y* = A' (y_0 - p) = 
        = A' y_0 - A' A'.T alpha = A' (y - x_0) - A' A'.T alpha =
        = A' y - b' - A' A'.T alpha

        10. So, we have got the formula:
        A' A'.T alpha = A' y - b'
        in the code it is equivalent to solving the 
        linear system:
          alpha = np.linalg.solve(Mat, vec)
        '''

        Mat = A_indep @ A_indep.T
        vec = A_indep @ y - b_indep
        alpha = np.linalg.solve(Mat, vec)

        res_vector = A_indep.T @ alpha
        res_point = y - res_vector
        return(res_point)
